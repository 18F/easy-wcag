# Vision
We're building an easy to use WCAG 2.0 AA assessment tool. This tool will make WCAG 2.0 assessments more approachable so that TTS staff can complete basic accessibility audits, and fix issues, without having to go to an expert. This will help us follow the guidance issued in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and will ultimately help TTS staff level up their accessibility knowledge.

You can read more in our [framing doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k6StLWnN3u193W4GNZRVIicxNxiJl5N2G1RgB60V5m0).

# Status
Right now we're working on a limited MVP, focused on supporting TTS staff who are building relatively simple static webistes.

Major value add:
- The WCAG 2.0 AA assessment is approachable and understandable.
- After completing the self-assessment, you get a list of the things you need to fix.
- There is approachable and understandable guidance about how to fix things.
